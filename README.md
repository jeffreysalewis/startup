## About (Elevator Pitch)
Have you ever worried about what your kids are doing online? The internet used to have several sites geared towards kids where they could make friends a safe environment, such as Club Penguin or Poptropica, but now there are few sites that are supported. My startup, Move! is going to be an interactive virtual space where users can chat and move their chosen avatars, geared specifically towards kids. You can add users to your friend list to chat with them, and safe chat is automatically enabled, so you don't have to worry about exposing kids to the unsavory parts of the internet. Your kids will love the simple and intuitive design and will support their growing imagination!
